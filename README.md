# ShowMePasswords_VSCode
Based on the original Show Me Passwords for SQL Developer by @tomecode
    Original Code: https://github.com/tomecode/show-me-password-sqldev-jdev

With the migration from the "Legacy" standalone Oracle SQL Developer to the new Extension for VS Code, I wanted to re-create the functionality for the new generation of SQL Developer as the original plugin appears abandoned. 

### Pre-Requisites
  1. Installed Oracle SQL Developer for VS Code:  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oracle.sql-developer
  2. Created connections in SQL Developer Extension
